Backgroud:
*On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage,
the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, 
killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 
Translated 32% survival rate.

*One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that
there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.

*Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking,
some groups of people were more likely to survive than others,
such as women, children, and the upper-class.



Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers
who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster,
can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information,
if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.
